OSM diaries TOC
===============

This is a [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) user script for the
[OpenStreetMap diaries](http://www.openstreetmap.org/diary) page.
It adds a table of contents to that site and highlights the corresponding table
entry for new posts or comments since the last visit.

Since the OpenStreetMap website is currently lacking a notification feature for
the user diaries, this is a way to improve this situation to some degree.
The detection of new comments is implemented by storing and comparing the
language dependent comments link text. So it doesn't work if switching the
website language. In this case, all comments will appear to be new again.

To use this script in Firefox, you first need to install the Greasemonkey plugin for Firefox.
To use it in Chrome, you need to install Tampermonkey.
